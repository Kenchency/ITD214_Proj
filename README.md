## About The Project

As members of a support group, our goal is to establish an online support system that enhances emotional support and fosters a sense of community and anonymity for those seeking help. This platform is designed to connect individuals who feel lonely or socially isolated, allowing them to share experiences, coping strategies, and find solidarity with others facing similar challenges.

By gaining insights into the needs, preferences, and behaviors of the r/foreveralone community, we aim to tailor the platform‚Äôs content to better align with user expectations. Ultimately, our mission is to create a positive and supportive online environment that builds a strong sense of community and empowers users to navigate their challenges more effectively.

To measure our success, we aim for at least 20% of the expressed sentiment from users to be positive after the community is established.

## About the Assignment

![240522286_10158550181058067_5582075181331768417_n](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d99eb4e-fe1a-4ebc-8075-bddaed53ebdd)

In a recent survey reported by Channel News Asia, it was found that the prevalence of mental health issues in Singapore is rising, with young adults having the highest proportion at 25.3%. In February 2024, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong passed a motion on advancing mental health, highlighting the growing importance of this issue both in Singapore and globally.
As part of a support group initiative, this project aims to develop a platform focused on providing emotional support, fostering a sense of community, and ensuring anonymity for those seeking help. By applying machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and conducting correlation analysis, this study seeks to predict the likelihood of depression and identify the most influential features. 
Leveraging these data-driven insights allows for the identification of key demographic and behavioural factors contributing to depression risk, enabling tailored interventions and content optimization. The goal is to create a positive and engaging environment that empowers users to address their mental health challenges effectively.

## Project Python Notebook File
The following are two Python notebook files utilized for my project:
1. ITD214 (Finalized).ipynb: This notebook is used alongside the foreveralone.csv dataset for data preparation, model training, analysis, and discussion of results.
2. ITD214 Business_Goals (Measurement).ipynb: This notebook is used with the lonely.csv dataset to measure the business goals outlined in the project.
